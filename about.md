I'm a mid level 30 Human... uhm Dad, who loves playing single-player tabletop games and video games. While I do enjoy playing multiplayer games, the reality of being a parent to a level 2, soon to be level 3 toddler has made gaming a little tricky. This is a big reason as to why I am mainly only playing single-player games nowadays. This is not to say that single-player games are any less fun. In fact I find that being able to play a game on my own pace and being able create my own story within a game ends up being a very satisfying experience.

### About This Blog

Whenever I find a new combo that works in Lord of the Rings LCG, or a location where I found Power Armor in Fallout 4 (yes I still play Fallout 4), or a new tactic that helps me win in NBA 2K19, or a new strategy that works in Heroes of Terrinoth, I write those down on a notebook I keep at home, or on my phone. 

I realized that those notes, thoughts, ideas, might be helpful to other gamers as well, so I thought I might as well share them online. An online gaming journal of sorts, written by a dad who can never seem to finish one game of Lord of the Rings LCG in one sitting. *(Actually when I do finish a game in one sitting, it usually means I just lost, badly... >_<)*
