I probably could have waited until tomorrow to officially create this blog, but I had some free time so why not make use of it, 
right? Actually I was debating with myself as to whether I should just play another game of Lord of the Rings LCG, or work on 
this blog. I chose the latter. Hello there stranger, welcome to my new gaming blog! On this site I plan to share notes, tips, 
ideas, solutions that I've compiled from playing various tabletop games and video games.

To start off, I'm coming to you all the way down from the depths of Moria, where I tried to help a band of Dwarves escape and 
failed miserably. If there's one thing you can say about the Lord of the Rings LCG card game, it's that it is not an easy game. 
So let's get to some lessons I have learned while playing the Flight from Moria quest, for the 7th time.

### Bypassing Quest Stages

One of the unique mechanics on the Flight from Moria scenario is having a quest deck. A quest deck consists of multiple Stage 
2 quest cards. There are no Stage 3 quest cards in this scenario. To win the game, you have to find the correct Stage 2 quest 
card that will allow you to escape the mines and therefore win the game.

Another unique mechanic is the ability to bypass quest stages. Why then would you want to bypass quest stages? That is because 
most of the Stage 2 quest cards award you a Victory point when you complete them. And these victory points only serve to 
strengthen [The Nameless Fear](http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Nameless-Fear-KD) enemy which sits on the staging area 
throughout the course of the game. The more Stage 2 quest cards you complete, the stronger the Threat/Attack values become for 
The Nameless Fear. At the very least, you should not let the total amount of Victory Points get to 5, because if it does and 
[A Foe Beyond](http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/A-Foe-Beyond-KD) is revealed, one hero will take 5 damage. Assigning 5 
points of damage to a hero usually means they end up dead. 

### Sudden Pitfall

Beware the [Sudden Pitfall Treachery card](http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Sudden-Pitfall-KD). This card will ruin your 
game if you're not careful. I mean decreasing the damage this treachery card does seems pretty straightforward; just always 
quest with more than 1 character, the other character being one you are okay with discarding. So you want to be questing with 
at least 1 expendable ally.

Sometimes though you don't have any allies in place and you are forced to quest using only your heroes. These are the times 
when this card will really hit you hard. I have lost Bifur to this card at least twice already; both happened during the start 
of games. One was when I didn't have an ally in play yet at Round 1 and quested with both Bifur and Gimli. This treachery card 
came up and poof! The other was when I had Erebor Record Keeper in play, but still decided to quest with Bifur and Gimli 
instead, so that Gimli could be readied later by Erebor Record Keeper. That ended badly as well.

### Need a way to know the Top Card on the Encounter Deck

Lastly, without spoiling a very important Stage 2 quest card in the Flight From Moria scenario, I will just say that having a way to know what the top card on the encounter deck is, is going to make your life easier with this scenario. You can still probably win without that ability, but this scenario is hard enough as it is to play solo, having a card that can "scry" will certainly help. So a card like [Rumour from the Earth](http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Rumour-from-the-Earth-RtM) or 
[Henamarth Riversong](http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Henamarth-Riversong-Core) will help a lot.

So that's it for my first post. Hopefully other people would have learned something from this post. I'm taking a breather from playing this quest but will definitely give it a go again in the future. I will not move forward to another quest until I beat this one.
